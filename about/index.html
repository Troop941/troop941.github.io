<p>Boy Scouts of America Troop 941 is part of the San Francisco Bay Area Council, in the Twin Valley District. Our charter organization is VFW Post 6298 in Pleasanton, California, our Scoutmaster is Jim McMillin, and our Committee Chair is Jennifer Mello. Troop 941 uses the model of the Boy Scouts program as Lord Baden Powell intended, structured around the patrol method and applying various methods he found useful. We are a full uniform troop that helps Scouts work on activities in groups of 8-10 boys, which are called patrols. Our troop consists of 7 "regular" patrols and a leadership patrol.  The Scouts select new leaders (Senior Patrol Leader, Patrol Leaders) every six months through a voting process.  The new leadership group appoints auxiliary positions to aid in the troop's ability to function as a "boy-led" unit. We meet as a troop during the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Monday nights of each month, at Ridgeview Hope Church.  Patrols and the Patrol Leaders Council (PLC) meet during the first week of the month at locations determined by the Scouts. The troop is active in monthly activities and outings which allow the boys to learn new skills and grow in maturity.  They take on increasing responsibility as they become leaders in the patrols and troop. Webelos who join our troop in the early spring are put into specially created â€œNew Scout" patrols led by Troop Guides (experienced older scouts).  New Scout patrols are dissolved in the fall, at which point the scouts are integrated into the regular patrols.</p>
